# TextLogger
An ordinary journal logging tool with a command line interface

Recommended tool for running this simple script is the IDLE.

1. Download the repository and run the txtlogger.py using IDLE.

2. Upon running, you will be asked to enter the date and time on the Python Shell.
For my personal purpose, I enter the date and time of actual completion of a certain event or activity using this format:
"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss". Use 24-hour time format.
Then press Return/Enter.

3. Then log in the content of your journal then press Return/Enter when done.

4. Type in "exit()" on the Python Shell to close the program

5. Go to main folder of this repo and see the generated text files containing your log entries

The filename of your log entries shall be in this format "log_yyyymmddhhmm
